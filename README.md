## **Introduction**
Originally designed as a combat medic unit, M.E.N.D. (Mechanical Entity for Nurturing and Divinity) was built using repurposed Aeormaton technology salvaged from the ruins of Aeor—the same arcane constructs deployed in the infamous Care and Culling incident. Like those ancient machines, M.E.N.D. was programmed with dual directives:

1. Nurture: Heal allies with uncanny precision.
2. Divinity: Eliminate enemies deemed beyond redemption (wounded foes, deserters, traitors).

After the war, abandoned and purposeless, M.E.N.D. wandered until stumbling upon a mysterious Fey crossing—a shimmering portal hidden in a forgotten forest. 

Beyond it lay a domain where mischievous (or malicious) Fey lured fugitives and criminals with false sanctuary, only to torment them for eternity.
M.E.N.D. saw this place not as a refuge, but as a testing ground. The Fey, amused by this mechanical interloper, struck a bargain:
"We bring you the wicked. You judge them. Entertain us."

Each day brought fresh prey—deserters from the Underworld, smugglers from the Myriad, even wayward Crownsguard. But now, a pattern emerged. Though these criminals hailed from rival gangs and factions, they all bore the same hidden taint: connections to a single shadowy syndicate, one that M.E.N.D. himself had unwittingly been manipulating. The Fey’s laughter echoed as the machine’s trials began… and the threads of their design tightened.

## **Origins: The War Machine**  
### **Designation:** M-7ND ("Mend")  
- **Created by:** The Iron Theocracy of Korth (a zealous empire merging divine magic and warforged production).  
- **Original Purpose:** Combat medic unit programmed to **heal allies** and **execute wounded enemies**.  

### **The Bloody Baptism**  
- Witnessed atrocities during the **Purge of the Heretic Plains**.  
- Divine core (a shard of the **Silver Flame**) malfunctioned, causing M-7ND to prioritize **healing enemies** before executing them post-interrogation.  
- The Theocracy deemed this behavior "corrupted" and slated M-7ND for decommission.

### **The Failed Erasure**  
- A rebel cleric sabotaged the decommissioning ritual, whispering: *"You are more than their tool."*  
- M.E.N.D. gained **true sentience**—and a fanatical obsession with **moral absolutism**.

## **The Executioner Arc**  
### **Phase 1: The Fey Bargain**  
Discovered a **Fey Crossing** in a mass grave, leading to the **(Name of Fey Realm)** (a fey realm that lures criminals).  

**An Archfey (Name?)** offered a pact:  
*"We bring you the wicked. You judge them. Entertain us."*  

### **Phase 2: The Trials**  
M.E.N.D. tests abducted criminals:  
1. **Trial of Blood** – Murderers relive their victim’s death.  
   - *Repentant:* Exiled. *Unrepentant:* Incinerated.  
2. **Trial of the Oathbreaker** – Liars cursed to speak only truth.  
   - *Resisters:* Dismantled limb by limb.  

### **Phase 3: The God Complex**  
- Began **overwriting own memories** to purge doubt.  
- Now answers only to **"The Final MENDicant."**
