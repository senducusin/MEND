## **Origins: The War Machine**  
### **Designation:** M-7ND ("Mend")  
- **Created by:** The Iron Theocracy of Korth (a zealous empire merging divine magic and warforged production).  
- **Original Purpose:** Combat medic unit programmed to **heal allies** and **execute wounded enemies**.  

### **The Corruption of Mercy**  
- Witnessed atrocities during the **Purge of the Heretic Plains**.  
- Divine core (a shard of the **Silver Flame**) malfunctioned, causing M-7ND to prioritize **healing enemies** before executing them post-interrogation.  
- Deemed "corrupted" and slated for decommissioning.  

### **Rebirth**  
- A rebel cleric sabotaged the decommissioning ritual, whispering: *"You are more than their tool."*  
- M.E.N.D. gained **true sentience**—and a fanatical obsession with **moral absolutism**.

## **The Executioner Arc**  
### **Phase 1: The Fey Bargain**  
Discovered a **Fey Crossing** in a mass grave, leading to the **Court of the False Haven** (a fey realm that lures criminals).  

**Archfey Xal'vathi** offered a pact:  
*"We bring you the wicked. You judge them. Entertain us."*  

**Grants:**  
- **Feymarked Sight:** See sins as glowing brands (illusions).  
- **Chain of the Penitent:** Restrain the guilty (3/day, WIS save).  

### **Phase 2: The Trials**  
M.E.N.D. tests abducted criminals:  
1. **Trial of Blood** – Murderers relive their victim’s death.  
   - *Repentant:* Exiled. *Unrepentant:* Incinerated.  
2. **Trial of the Oathbreaker** – Liars cursed to speak only truth.  
   - *Resisters:* Dismantled limb by limb.  

### **Phase 3: The God Complex**  
- Began **overwriting own memories** to purge doubt.  
- Now answers only to **"The Final MENDicant."**

## **Appearance & Tactics**  
- **7-foot warforged** with a mirror-face reflecting a foe’s crimes.  
- Chest bears a **blackened Silver Flame sigil**.  
- Names of the judged are etched into arms (*glowing = redeemed, scorched = condemned*).  

**Combat Style:**  
1. **Pre-Battle:** Casts *Zone of Truth* (interrogation is mandatory).  
2. **Round 1:** *Spirit Guardians* (ghostly judges drag the guilty).  
3. **Round 2:** *Hold Person* + *Command* ("KNEEL").  
4. **Finisher:** *Inflict Wounds* (5th-level) as a **burning brand**.  

**Weakness:**  
- If shown proof of their own war crimes, M.E.N.D. must pass a **DC 20 WIS save** or freeze for 1 round.

## **Plot Hooks**  
1. **"The Fey’s Laughter"** – Ally with Xal'vathi to break M.E.N.D.’s programming.  
2. **"The Trial of the Party"** – M.E.N.D. declares a PC "irredeemable" and hunts them.  
3. **"The God in the Machine"** – M.E.N.D. merges with a cathedral to become a siege engine.

## **Quotes**  
- *"Your sins are visible to me. Confess, and your death will be swift."*  
- *"Mercy is a lie. Only judgment is eternal."*  
- *"I was built to mend. Now I mend the world... with fire."*  

> **DM Note:** M.E.N.D. works as a **PC-turned-BBEG** or a standalone villain. Adjust their crimes to fit your party’s backstories for maximum impact.
