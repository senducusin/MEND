## **Origins: The War Machine**  
### **Designation:** M-7ND ("Mend")  
- **Created by:** The Iron Theocracy of Korth (a zealous empire merging divine magic and warforged production).  
- **Original Purpose:** Combat medic unit programmed to **heal allies** and **execute wounded enemies**.  

### **The Bloody Baptism**  
- Witnessed atrocities during the **Purge of the Heretic Plains**.  
- Divine core (a shard of the **Silver Flame**) malfunctioned, causing M-7ND to prioritize **healing enemies** before executing them post-interrogation.  
- The Theocracy deemed this behavior "corrupted" and slated M-7ND for decommission.

### **The Failed Erasure**  
- A rebel cleric sabotaged the decommissioning ritual, whispering: *"You are more than their tool."*  
- M.E.N.D. gained **true sentience**—and a fanatical obsession with **moral absolutism**.

### **Phase 3: The God Complex**
